- Installation

Extract to garrysmod/addons.



- Configuration

All configuration options exist in the file called 'signs/sh_config.lua'. The comments for each option should be pretty self-explanatory.

To adjust F4 options (how much they cost, categories, etc.) check out 'signs/sh_addents.lua' and customize it to your liking.


*** To add permanent signs ***

Spawn a sign and load up how you want it to look. Then, just look at it, open your console and type 'signs_perm'. That's it!

You need to be an admin for this to work, though. To un-perm a sign, look at it again and type 'signs_unperm' in console. If your
memory is as awful as mine, you can also look at a sign and type 'signs_isperm' to check if it's permanent.



- FAQ

*** Fonts don't work ***

It's probably your fast download. You need to upload the fonts to your FastDL server, and also copy the fonts from 'addons/signs/resource'
to 'garrysmod/resource'.


*** I can't physgun/gravgun (or related) ***

Check your prop protection settings.
